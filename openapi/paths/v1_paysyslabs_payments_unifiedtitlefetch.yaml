    The unified title fetch is a generic method to get beneficiary (receiver)
    account details from the member bank.The method is having a following two
    additional functionalities compare to standard title fetch method:



    1- Preferred Rail: The initiator has provision to set the preferred rail
    either the title fetch will be done via RAAST or 1LINK. The request
    parameter will identify the preferred route



    2- Fall-back option: In case if title fetch failed with the preferred rail
    the system will auto attempt the title fetch from alternate rail. The option
    is controllable via request parameters.
